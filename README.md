# Java Projects:

## A collection of Java programming challenges I've attempted.

### Basic Calculator
In this challenge, I have attempted to build a simple calculator that lets the user enter two numeric values on the console. 
The application then adds the values together and displays the result.

### OddNums
In this challenge, I have attempted to build an application that lets the user enter two numbers on the console. 
After receiving the input from the user, the application checks if the second number is greater that the first number. 
If true, if finds the odd numbers between two numbers and displays it in the console. Otherwise, asks the user to input a number that is greater that the first number.

### Guessing Game
In this challenge, I have attempted to build an application that asks the user a question and lets the user three attempts. 
If the user finds the answer, it displays a success message, otherwise it displays in the console that the user run out of attempts. 

### Power Function
In this challenge, I have attempted to build a simple Java program that takes to numbers from the user and returns the first number to the power of the second number. 

### ReverseString Function
In this challenge, I coded a simple program that takes a string and outputs its reverese.

### Check Prime Number Function
In this challenge, I wrote a function that takes a number and lets the user know whether the number is a prime number or not. 

### Simple Mortgage Calculator
In this challenge, I wrote a program that calculates the monthly morgage payment. It takes user input and makes the calculation based on this formula: M = P [ I ( 1 + I )^N ] / [ ( 1 + I )^N â€“ 1 ].
